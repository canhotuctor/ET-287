# ET-287

sharing some of my work on the elective subject **Signal Processsing with Neural Networks** at *Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica (ITA) - Brazil*.

The repository is divided on units, each one containing some practical exercises and one or more projects. The units are:

## Unit 1: Python practices
- Project: 'Analyzing a Wine Dataset'
    - objective: familiarize with dataset handling and some of the tools that would be used in the course.

## Unit 2: Introduction to Neural Networks
- Project: 'Analyzing BCI data'
    - objective: familiarize with the concept of neural networks and how they can be used to classify data.

- Project: 'Steel plate defect Detection'
    - objective: familiarize with the concept of MLP Networks and how they can be used to detect patterns on data.

## Unit 3: Convolutional Neural Networks
- Project: 'Doppler RAD-DAR image classification'
    - objective: familiarize with the concept of Convolutional Neural Networks and how they can be used to classify images.

## Unit 4: Recurrent Neural Networks
- Project: 'Weather Forecasting'
    - objective: familiarize with the concept of Recurrent Neural Networks and how they can be used to forecast time series data.

Some of the exercises will still be added to the repository, as well as the final project, which is in development at the moment.
