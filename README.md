# ET-287

### sharing some of my work on the elective subject "Signal Processsing with Neural Networks" at Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica (ITA) - Brazil.

The repository is divided on units, each one containing some practical exercises and a final project. The units are:

## Unit 1: Python practices
- Project: 'Analyzing a Wine Dataset'
    - objective: familiarize with dataset handling and some of the tools that would be used in the course.

## Unit 2: Introduction to Neural Networks
- Project: 'Analyzing BCI data'
    - objective: familiarize with the concept of neural networks and how they can be used to classify data.
